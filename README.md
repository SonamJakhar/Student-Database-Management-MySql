# Student-Database-Management-MySql
### Overview


This project is a Student Database Management System (SDMS) designed to modernize and streamline how educational institutions manage student information. It replaces traditional, manual record-keeping methods with an efficient, scalable, and secure digital system using MySQL databases.

### Features


Manage student personal details, academic records, contact information, and CGPA.

Organize data related to branches, hostels, and student clubs.

Entity-Relationship (ER) model with clear relationships between students, branches, hostels, and clubs.

Efficient SQL scripts for creating databases, tables, and populating sample data.

Secure foreign key constraints ensuring data integrity.

### Technologies Used


Database: MySQL

Concepts: DBMS, ER Modeling, SQL DDL & DML Commands

### Database Structure


Tables: Students, Branches, Hostels, Clubs

Primary Keys: Roll_No, Branch_name, Hostel_Name, Club_Name

### Relationships:


Students belong to one branch (Many-to-One).

Students can be linked with hostels and clubs (for future extensions).

### Sample Data


Includes sample inserts for 5 branches: CSE, IT, ECE, EE, and ME.

Each branch has 10 students with realistic information like phone numbers, emails, DOBs, addresses, and CGPAs.

Hostels and clubs are also populated with example entries.

### Purpose


Enhance administrative efficiency.

Improve data security, accessibility, and retrieval. 

Support future scalability for larger educational setups.

### Conclusion


Implementing a system like SDMS ensures educational institutions can manage their students' information accurately and effectively, helping support academic excellence and operational growth.
